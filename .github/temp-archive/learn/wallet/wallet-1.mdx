### Set up your environment

For this project you should install 


* **Git**. Essential tool for every developer to work with repositories. Download it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
* **NodeJS**. We will use JavaScript with TypeScript mode as the most popular choice for dApp development on TON. Download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
* **JavaScript IDE**. Your normal choice for development. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), for example.
* **Wallet app**. You need one of TON noncustodial testnet [wallet app](docs/participate/wallets/apps) (better with support Walletv4), for example [Sandbox](https://apps.apple.com/app/ton-development-wallet/id1607857373)/[Tonkeeper](https://tonkeeper.com/). This is as part of simplify demonstration, you also can get access to your wallet from code, example added in demo.

### Tact wallet demo project
Get tact-wallet project from git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ton-community/tact-wallet
cd tact-wallet
```

This project has ready to use TACT compiler, typescript + jest with [@tact-lang/emulator](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-emulator), example how to test and deploy.
You have ready-to-use commands configured for contract. Try to input them in terminal and look how it works:

```bash
yarn test # To test contract
yarn build # To build contract
yarn deploy # To deploy contract via deployment link
yarn deploy-api # To deploy through API(need to input deployment wallet in wallet.deploy-api.ts before using)
```

### Briefing for Tact project structure

In the `tact-wallet/sources/` directory placed core project files, that defines what `yarn` commands will do:

1. File `wallet.tact` contract on Tact language, that will be compiled with Tact compiler in `yarn build`
2. File `wallet.spec.ts` contents unit tests for `yarn tests` command. This command allow to launch local tests on your local IDE. Not necessary for deployment.
3. File `wallet.deploy.ts` is a helper, that allow to deploy your `wallet.tact` compiled file(src/output) with deployment link. From the beginning you can deploy your smart contract via [Sandbox](https://apps.apple.com/app/ton-development-wallet/id1607857373)/[Tonkeeper](https://tonkeeper.com/) application.
4. Describes alternative deployment script `wallet.deploy-api.ts` for `yarn deploy-api` according to your `contract.tact` to send deployment message from deployment wallet. You need to input your deployment wallet 24 words [here](sources/wallet.deploy-api.ts#L19).


### What is wallet contract general idea?

Wallet similar to usual smart contract serve as a platform for managing and transferring funds in a decentralized and secure manner. However, it is important to note that while a smart contract may have built-in features for handling funds, additional steps may be necessary to make the user experience more convenient and secure. This may involve handling additional user stories and implementing additional features to meet real-life requirements.

Let's describe small list of feature for wallet contract:
* Deployment of smart contract where placed information of its owner with public key.
* Requests for action with funds by owner.
* Get and handle messages from other smart-contracts, including incoming transfer of funds.


<Callout type="info" emoji="📚️">
Explorers recognize contract's type by hash of the smart contract's code or/and by interfaces founded in smart contract. If you check your common wallet contract with [explorer](https://tonscan.org/)([testnet explorer](https://testnet.tonscan.org/)), you will see that it recognized with type "wallet". From this side, tact-wallet contract is a new version, and it will have different hash(because of original FunC contract and FunC compiled from Tact will be absolutely different). On the same reason current wallet application will not support Tact contract until they add its tact version to their applications.
