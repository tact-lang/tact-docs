# Tact Hello World

## Tact contract structure

### Tact's facts #2

**tact-guide-template** is basic demo project for developing smart contract on Tact language. Let's learn general things about this:

* By default, this project has a number of additional frameworks used in it, that specified in `yarn`.
* Most important directory for us placed in `tact-guide-template/sources/` directory and contents following:
```
+--tact-guide-template
|   +--sources
|   |  +-- contract.deploy.ts
|   |  +-- contract.spec.ts
|   |  +-- contract.tact

```
*  `contract.tact` - Tact language smart contract will be written here. 
*  `contract.spec.ts` - contents tests for using `yarn tests` for launching local tests. Not necessary part for deployment.
*  `contract.deploy.ts` - contents instructions to generate a deployment link. This link includes all necessary information to deploy our smart contract in blockchain.

When a smart contract is delivered in TON Blockchain as bytecode he becomes **deployed**.

As a result we will use three yarn commands to work with Tact project:
```bash
yarn build # To build contract
yarn test # To test contract
yarn deploy # To deploy contract
```

### Tactical practice #2
#### Get template from GitHub

Update dependencies in project via yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```

Now check, that everything is ok, input command:

```bash
yarn build
```
This command will initiate the Tact compiler to build the current `tact.contract`.
Currently, the contract has no content, but the compiler should work.
The result of success executing this should be seen in your terminal window like the following:
