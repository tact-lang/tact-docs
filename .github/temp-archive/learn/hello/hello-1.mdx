# Tact Hello World

## Tact and TON terms

In this guide, we will walk through the process of creating and deploying a simple smart contract using the Tact program language.
The main goal is trying and touch the smart contract developing process and find out what you should learn next.
You need to spend about one-two hours, depending on your background knowledge.

### Tact's facts #1

Five things you need to know in the beginning:

* Smart contract is a computer program that stores and executes in blockchain.
* Blockchain is a shared and structured way to keep data. Data stored in blockchain is impossible to edit and be replaced with fake.
* TON Blockchain works on its own special program software, called the Ton Virtual Machine (TVM). 
* Tact is a computer language for developing smart contracts on the TON blockchain.
* Tact uses JavaScript frameworks, so basic knowledge of them helps you learn it faster. However, if you are just a newcomer it is possible to learn from the scratch.

 **Blockchain** is like a digital notebook where important information is written down and shared with many people. Once something is written in the notebook, it can't be changed or erased. It's like a permanent record that everyone can trust. But instead of a notebook, it is stored on multiple servers. And instead of just one person writing in it, many people can write in it at the same time. This way, everyone can see and agree on the information that is written in the blockchain. And because it's placed on a multiple servers, it's safe and can't be lost or changed by accident.

### Tactical practice #1
#### Set up your environment

Get ready to build your own blockchain creation! First, you'll need to gather a few tools to help you along the way.

- **Git** is like a magic toolbox for developers. It helps you keep track of all the different parts of your project, so you can work on them together with your team. You can download it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **NodeJS** is a central tool in JavaScript world. We'll be using JavaScript and its special version called TypeScript to create our smart contract. You can download it  [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- **JavaScript IDE** is like your own personal workshop. It's where you'll be building and designing your code, a text editor for code with highlighting. A popular choice is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), for example. Get it now and let's get building!
- **Tact language** extension for IDE makes it more comfortable to work. For example, in VS Code you can install an [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ton-community.tact-vscode).

After the preparation of developer tools is done, download *tact-guide-template* project and open it in your IDE.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ton-community/tact-guide-template
cd tact-guide-template
```
