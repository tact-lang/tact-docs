# Overview

Some standard libraries (also referred to as stdlibs) come bundled with Tact compiler, but aren't automatically included to your project until explicitly made to.

To import any standard library, use the `import{:tact}` statement followed by the name of that library in a [string](/language/ref/strings), like so:

```tact
import "@stdlib/deploy"; // this would include everything from @stdlib/deploy library into your codebase
```
