# Overview

Tact allows you to import Tact and [FunC](https://docs.ton.org/develop/func/overview) code — any given `.tact` or `.fc`/`.func` file can be imported into your project. Additionally, Tact's compiler has a versatile set of standard libraries, which come bundled in.

This page describes how to use bundled libraries, and how to import other Tact or FunC code.

NOTE: All imported code is combined together with yours, so it's important to avoid name collisions and always double-check the sources!

## Standard libraries

Standard libraries (also referred to as stdlib) come bundled with Tact compiler, but not automatically included to your project until explicitly made to.

To import any standard library, use the `import` statement followed by the name of that library in a [string](/language/ref/strings), like so:

```tact
import "@stdlib/deploy"; // this would include everything from @stdlib/deploy library into your codebase
```

List of standard libraries:

Library                | Description                                                   | Commonly used APIs
-------                | -----------                                                   | ------------------
[@stdlib/config][1]    | Config and elector address retrieval.                         | `getConfigAddress`, `getElectorAddress`
[@stdlib/content][2]   | Encoding off-chain link [strings][str] to a [Cell][cell].     | `createOffchainContent`
[@stdlib/deploy][3]    | Unified mechanism for deployments.                            | `Deployable`, `FactoryDeployable`
[@stdlib/dns][4]       | Resolution of [DNS](https://docs.ton.org/participate/web3/dns) names.                                 | `DNSResolver`, `dnsInternalVerify`
[@stdlib/ownable][5]   | Traits for ownership management.                              | `Ownable`, `OwnableTransferable`
[@stdlib/stoppable][6] | Traits that allow contract stops. Requires [@stdlib/ownable][5]. | `Stoppable`, `Resumable`

## Import Tact code

In addition to standard libraries, it's possible to import any Tact code using the `import` statement and providing a relative path to the target `.tact` file like so:

```tact
import "./relative/path/to/the/target/tact/file.tact";
```

## Import FunC code

It's possible to import code written in FunC code directly just as it's done with Tact code imports:

```tact
import "./relative/path/to/the/target/func/file.fc";
```

But in order to use functions from such file, one has to declare them as `native` functions first. For example, when standard library [@stdlib/dns](/language/libs/dns) uses a `dns.fc` FunC file, it maps FunC functions to Tact ones like so:

```tact
// FunC code located in a file right next to the current Tact one:
import "./dns.fc";

// Mapping function signatures from FunC to Tact:
@name(dns_string_to_internal)
native dnsStringToInternal(str: String): Slice?;
```
