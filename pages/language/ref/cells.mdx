# Cells, Builders and Slices

Cells is a low level primitive that represents data in TON blockchain. Cell consists of a 1023 bits of data with up to 4 references to another Cells. Cells are read-only and immutable. Builders are immutable structures that can be used to construct Cells. Slices are a way to parse cells.

## beginCell

```tact
fun beginCell(): Builder
```

Creates a new empty Builder.

## Builder.endCell

```tact
extends fun endCell(self: Builder): Cell;
```

Extension function for the Builder.

Converts a Builder into an ordinary Cell.

## Builder.storeUint

```tact
extends fun storeUint(self: Builder, value: Int, bits: Int): Builder;
```

Extension function for the Builder.

Stores an unsigned `bits`-bit Int `value` into the Builder for `0 ≤ bits ≤ 257`. Returns modified Builder.

## Builder.storeInt

```tact
extends fun storeInt(self: Builder, value: Int, bits: Int): Builder;
```

Extension function for the Builder.

Stores a signed `bits`-bit Int `value` into the Builder for `0 ≤ bits ≤ 256`. Returns modified Builder.

## Builder.storeBool

```tact
extends fun storeBool(self: Builder, value: Bool): Builder;
```

Extension function for the Builder.

Stores a Bool `value` into the Builder. Writes `-1` if `value` is `true`, and writes `0` otherwise. Returns modified Builder.

## Builder.storeSlice

```tact
extends fun storeSlice(self: Builder, cell: Slice): Builder;
```

Extension function for the Builder.

Stores a Slice `cell` into the Builder. Returns modified Builder.

## Builder.storeCoins

```tact
extends fun storeCoins(self: Builder, value: Int): Builder;
```

Extension function for the Builder.

Stores (serializes) an integer `value` in the range `0..2^120 − 1` into Builder. The serialization of `value` consists of a 4-bit unsigned big-endian integer `l`, which is the smallest integer `l ≥ 0`, such that `value < 2^8l`, followed by an `8l`-bit unsigned big-endian representation of `value`. If `value` does not belong to the supported range, a range check exception is thrown. Returns modified Builder.

This is the most common way of storing Toncoins.

## Builder.storeAddress

```tact
extends fun storeAddress(self: Builder, address: Address): Builder;
```

Extension function for the Builder.

Stores Address `address` in the Builder. Returns modified Builder.

```tact
extends fun storeRef(self: Builder, cell: Cell): Builder;
```

Extension function for the Builder.

Stores a reference Cell `cell` into the Builder. Returns modified Builder.

## Builder.refs

```tact
extends fun refs(self: Builder): Int;
```

Extension function for the Builder.

Returns the number of cell references already stored in the Builder as an Int.

Calculates hash of the Cell as an Int.

## Cell.asSlice

```tact
extends fun asSlice(self: Cell): Slice;
```

extends mutates fun loadInt(self: Slice, l: Int): Int;
```

Extension mutation function for the Slice.

Loads a signed `l`-bit Int from the Slice.

## Slice.preloadInt

```tact
extends mutates fun preloadInt(self: Slice, l: Int): Int;

## Slice.loadUint

```tact
extends mutates fun loadUint(self: Slice, l: Int): Int;
```

Extension mutation function for the Slice.

Loads an unsigned `l`-bit Int from the Slice.

## Slice.preloadUint

extends mutates fun preloadUint(self: Slice, l: Int): Int;
```

Extension mutation function for the Slice.

Preloads an unsigned `l`-bit Int from the Slice.

## Slice.loadBits

```tact
extends mutates fun loadBits(self: Slice, l: Int): Slice;
```

Loads the first `0 ≤ l ≤ 1023` bits from the Slice, and returns it as a separate Slice.

## Slice.preloadBits

```tact
extends mutates fun preloadBits(self: Slice, l: Int): Slice;
```

Extension mutation function for the Slice.

Preloads the first `0 ≤ l ≤ 1023` bits from the Slice, and returns it as a separate Slice.

## Slice.loadCoins
