# Common

List of a basic functions that are available in all smart contracts.

## sender
```tact
fun sender(): Address;
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Behaviour is undefined for get methods.
</Callout>

Returns the address of the sender of the current message.

## require
```tact
fun require(condition: Bool, error: String);
```
Checks `condition` and throws an exception with `error` message if `condition` is false.

## now
```tact
fun now(): Int
```
Returns current Unix time

## myBalance
```tact
myBalance(): Int;
```
Returns the remaining balance of the smart contract as Int value in NanoToncoins, where NanoToncoin = Toncoin * 10^(−9). Note that `send` do not update this field.

## myAddress
```tact
myAddress(): Address;
```
Returns the internal address of the current smart contract as a Address.

## newAddress

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
This method throws error if `chain` is invalid or if trying to create address in the masterchain without [masterchain enabled](/language/guides/masterchain).
</Callout>

```tact
fun newAddress(chain: Int, hash: Int): Address;
```

Creates a new address from `chain` and `hash` values.

## contractAddress
```tact
fun contractAddress(s: StateInit): Address;
```

Computes smart contract's Address in a workchain #0 based on its StateInit `s`, where `s` is a Struct consists of `code` and `data` Cells.

## contractAddressExt

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
This method throws error if `chain` is invalid or if trying to create address in the masterchain without [masterchain enabled](/language/guides/masterchain).
</Callout>

```tact
fun contractAddressExt(chain: Int, code: Cell, data: Cell): Address;
```
Computes smart contract's Address based on its workchain id `chain`, `code`, `data`.

## emit

```tact
fun emit(value: Cell);
```

Sends a message to the outer world with the purpose of logging and analyzing it later off-chain. The message does not have a recipient and is gas-efficient compared to alternatives.

## cell

```tact
fun cell("base64 boc"): Cell;
```

Compile-time function that embeds a Cell into the contract. The Cell is encoded in base64 format.

## ton

```tact
fun ton(value: String): Int;
```

Compile-time function that converts ton's from human-readable format to the integer.

## dump
```tact
fun dump(arg: Any);
```

Prints argument to the contract debug console. `debug` feature has to be enabled in `tact.config.json`.

## context
```tact
fun context(): Context;
```
Return Struct `Context`, that consists of

| value   | Int     | Amount of nanoToncoins in message                                                                                         |
