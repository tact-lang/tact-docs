# Random number generation

Random number generation in TON smart contracts.

## randomInt
```tact
fun randomInt(): Int;
```
Generates a new pseudo-random unsigned 256-bit integer `x`. The algorithm is as follows: if `r` is the old value of the random seed considered a 32-byte array (by constructing the big-endian representation of an unsigned 256-bit integer), then its `sha512(r)` is computed; the first 32 bytes of this hash are stored as the new value `r'` of the random seed, and the remaining 32 bytes are returned as the next random value `x`.

## random
```tact
fun random(from: Int, to: Int): Int;
```

Generates a new pseudo-random unsigned integer in the provided semi-closed interval: `from <= x < to` or `from >= x > to`, if both `from` and `to` are negative.
