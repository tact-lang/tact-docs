# Overview

import { Cards, Steps } from 'nextra/components'

Welcome to the **Language** section of Tact documentation — a place for becoming more familiar with the language in much more depth, compared to the [Book](/book).

Here are it's main contents:

<Steps>

### Reference

[Reference](/language/ref) is a comprehensive list of language syntax and semantics. More detailed than the [Book](/book) at the expense of no additional guidance — targeted at more experienced programmers!

### Libraries

[Libraries](/language/libs) sub-section explains how to use the bundled libraries, how to import external code and lists all the contents of the standard library.

### Specification

[Specification](/language/spec) page provides full Tact grammar written in Ohm language, which is used in the Tact's compiler. Aimed at more experienced programmers, but generally can still be very handy to quickly grasp all of the possible syntax in the language.

### Evolution

Finally, [Evolution](/language/evolution) sub-section gives insight on important decisions about language semantics, Tact's future and links to the up-to-date changelog of Tact updates.
