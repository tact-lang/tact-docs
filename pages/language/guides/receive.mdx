# Receive messages

TON is a distributed blockchain that means that communication between contracts is done by sending and receiving messages. The most common type of a message is internal message - message sent from one contract (or a wallet) to another.

## Receive internal messages

To receive a message of required type, you need to declare a receiver function, for example `receive("increment")`. This notation means declaration of a `receiver` function that will be called when a text with value `"increment"` is sent to the contract. The function body can modify the state of the contract and send messages to other contracts. It is impossbile to call `receiver` directly. If you need to reuse some logic you can declare a function and call it from `receiver`.

There are several receiver functions. All receiver functions are processed in the order they are listed below:
* `receive()` - called when an empty message is sent to the contract
* `receive("message")` - called when a text message with a specific comment is sent to the contract
* `receive(str: String)` - called when an arbitrary text message is sent to the contract
* `receive(msg: MyMessage)` - called when binary message of type `MyMessage` is sent to the contract
* `receive(msg: Slice)` - called when binary message of unknown type is sent to the contract


## Example

```tact

message MyMessage {
    value: Int;
}

contract MyContract {
    receive() {
        // ...
    }
    receive("message") {
        // ...
    }
    receive(str: String) {
        // ...
    }
    receive(msg: MyMessage) {
        // ...
    }
    receive(msg: Slice) {
        // ...
    }
}
```
