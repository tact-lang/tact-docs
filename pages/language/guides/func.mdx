# Compatibility with func

Tact itself compiles to `func` and allows to map Tact entities directly to various `func` and `tl-b` types.

## Convert types

Primitive types in `tact` are directly mapped to `func` one. All rules about copying variables are the same. One of the big differences is that there are no visible mutation operator in `tact` and most `Slice` operations mutate variables in place.

## Convert serialization

Tact structs and messages serialization is automatic unlike `func` where you need to define serialization logic manually. To build a `tact` types that serializes to specific `tl-b`.

Tact auto-layout algorithm is greedy. Means that it takes next variable, calculates it's size and tries to fit into a current cell. If it doesn't fit, it creates a new cell and continues. All inner structs for auto-layout are flattened before allocation.

All, except `Address`, optional types are serialized as `Maybe` in `tl-b`. There are no support for `Either` since it does not define what to pick during serialization in some cases.

### Examples

```tact
// _ value1:int257 = SomeValue;
struct SomeValue {
    value1: Int; // Default is 257 bits
}
```

```tact
// _ value1:int256 value2:uint32 = SomeValue;
struct SomeValue {
    value1: Int as int256;
    value2: Int as uint32;
}
```

```tact
// _ value1:bool value2:Maybe bool = SomeValue;
struct SomeValue {
    value1: Bool;
    value2: Bool?;
}
```

```tact
// _ cell:^cell = SomeValue;
struct SomeValue {
    cell: Cell; // Always stored as a reference
}
```

```tact
// _ cell:^slice = SomeValue;
struct SomeValue {
    cell: Slice; // Always stored as a reference
}
```

```tact
// _ value1:int256 value2:int256 value3:int256 ^[value4:int256] = SomeValue;
struct SomeValue {
    value1: Int as int256;
    value2: Int as int256;
    value3: Int as int256;
    value4: Int as int256;
}
```

```tact
// _ value1:int256 value2:int256 value3:int256 ^[value4:int256] flag:bool = SomeValue;
struct SomeValue {
    value1: Int as int256;
    value2: Int as int256;
    value3: Int as int256;
    flag: Bool; // Flag is written before value4 to avoid auto-layout to allocate it to the next cell
    value4: Int as int256;
}
```

```tact
// _ value1:int256 value2:int256 value3:int256 ^[value4:int256 flag:bool] = SomeValue;
struct SomeValue {
    value1: Int as int256;
    value2: Int as int256;
    value3: Int as int256;
    value4: Int as int256;
    flag: Bool;
}
```

```tact
// _ value1:int256 value2:^TailString value3:int256 = SomeValue;
struct SomeValue {
    value1: Int as int256;
    value2: String;
    value3: Int as int256;
}
```

## Convert received messages to `op` operations

Tact generates a unique `op` for every received typed  message, but it can be overwritten.

Code in `func`:
```func
() recv_internal(int msg_value, cell in_msg_cell, slice in_msg) impure {
    ;; incoming message code...

    ;; Receive MessageWithGeneratedOp message
    if (op == 1180414602) {
        ;; code...
    }

    ;; Receive MessageWithOverwrittenOP message
    if (op == 291) {
        ;; code...
    }

}
```
Will be in `tact`:
```tact
message MessageWithGeneratedOp {
    amount: Int as uint32;
}

message(0x123) MessageWithOverwrittenOP {
    amount: Int as uint32;
}

contract Contract {
    // Contract Body...

    receive(msg: MessageWithGeneratedOp) {
        // code...
    }

    receive(msg: MessageWithOverwrittenOP) {
        // code...
    }

}

```

## Convert get-methods

You can express everything except `list-style-lists` in Tact that would be compatible with `func`'s `get`-methods.

### Primitive return type
if `get-method` returns a primitive in `func`, you can implement it the same way in the `tact`.

Code in `func`:
```func
int seqno() method_id {
    return 0;
}
```

Will be in `tact`:
```tact
// Tact
get fun seqno(): Int {
    return 0;
}
```


### Tensor return types

In `func` there are a difference between tensor type `(int, int)` and `(int, (int))`, but for TVM there are no difference, they all represent a stack of two ints.

To convert tensor that returned from `func` get-method, you need to define a `struct` that has same amount of fields as tensor and in the same order.

Code in `func`:
```func
(int, slice, slice, cell) get_wallet_data() method_id {
    return ...;
}
```

Will be in `tact`:

```tact
struct JettonWalletData {
    balance: Int;
    owner: Address;
    master: Address;
    walletCode: Cell;
}


get fun get_wallet_data(): JettonWalletData {
    return ...;
}
```

### Tuple return type

In `func` if you are returning a tuple, instead of a tensor you need to follow process as for tensor type, but define return type of a get method as optional.

Code in `func`:
```func
[int, int] get_contract_state() method_id {
    return ...;
}
```

Will be in `tact`:

```tact
struct ContractState {
    valueA: Int;
    valueB: Int;
}


get fun get_contract_state(): ContractState? {
    return ...;
}
```

### Mixed tuple and tensor return types

When some of the tensors are a tuple, you need to define a struct as in previous steps and the tuple one must be defined as a separate struct.

Code in `func`:
```func
(int, [int, int]) get_contract_state() method_id {
    return ...;
}
```

Will be in `tact`:

```tact
struct ContractStateInner {
    valueA: Int;
    valueB: Int;
}
struct ContractState {
    valueA: Int;
    valueB: ContractStateInner;
}


get fun get_contract_state(): ContractState {
    return ...;
}
```

### Arguments mapping

Conversion of get-methods arguments are straight forward. Each argument is mapped as-is to `func` one, and each tuple is mapped to a struct.

Code in `func`:
```func
(int, [int, int]) get_contract_state(int arg1, [int,int] arg2) method_id {
    return ...;
}
```

Will be in `tact`:

```tact
struct ContractStateArg2 {
    valueA: Int;
    valueB: Int;
}

struct ContractStateInner {
    valueA: Int;
    valueB: Int;
}
struct ContractState {
    valueA: Int;
    valueB: ContractStateInner;
}


get fun get_contract_state(arg1: Int, arg2: ContractStateArg2): ContractState {
    return ...;
}
```
