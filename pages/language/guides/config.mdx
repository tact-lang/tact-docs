# Configuration

`tact.config.json` is an entry point to Tact projects. It is a JSON file that contains the list of all projects and compiler parameters.

## Project description

Each project is described by the following fields:
* `name` is the name of a project. All generated files are prefixed with this name.
* `path` is the path to a root Tact file.
* `output` is the path to a directory where all generated files will be placed.
* `parameters` is a dictionary of parameters that will be passed to a compiler.
* `experimental` is a dictionary of experimental features that will be enabled for this project.

## Parameters

Tact support next parameters:
* `debug: true`. Enables debug output of a contract. It is useful for debugging purposes. Enabling this contract would report that it was compiled in debug mode using the `supported_interfaces` method.
* `masterchain: true`. Enables [masterchain support](/language/guides/masterchain) in the contract.

## Example

```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "name": "sample",
      "path": "./sources/sample.tact",
      "output": "./sources/output",
      "options": {
        "debug": true,
        "experimental": {
          "inline": true
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Experimental

Tact support next experimental parameters:

* `inline: true`. Enables inlining of all functions in contracts. Could reduce gas usage at the cost of a bigger contract.
