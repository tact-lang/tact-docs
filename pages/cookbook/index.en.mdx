The main reason for making the Tact Cookbook is to gather all the experiences of Tact developers in one place so that future developers can use it. This section of the documentation is more focused on everyday tasks that every Tact developer resolves during the development of smart contracts.

Use it as a recipe book for cooking up delightful smart contracts on TON Blockchain without re-inventing the wheel in the process.

### Single contract [#single-contract]

Following pages focus on single-contract examples and cover a wide range of topics:

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<OneIcon />}
    title="Single-contract communication"
    href="/cookbook/single-communication"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<GearIcon />}
    title="Type conversion"
    href="/cookbook/type-conversion"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<BoxIcon />}
    title="Data structures"
    href="/cookbook/data-structures"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<FormulaIcon />}
    title="Algorithms"
    href="/cookbook/algo"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<RowsIcon />}
    title="Time and date"
    href="/cookbook/time"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<WarningIcon />}
    title="Access control"
    href="/cookbook/access"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<StarsIcon />}
    title="Randomness"
    href="/cookbook/random"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<DropperIcon />}
    title="Miscellaneous"
    href="/cookbook/misc"
  />
</Cards>

### Multiple contracts [#multiple-contracts]

Following pages focus on multi-contract examples, exploring the scalable nature of TON Blockchain:

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<DiagramIcon />}
    title="Multi-contract communication"
    href="/cookbook/multi-communication"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<LightningIcon />}
    title="Fungible Tokens (Jettons)"
    href="/cookbook/jettons"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<IdCardIcon />}
    title="Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)"
    href="/cookbook/nfts"
  />
</Cards>

Additionally, there are examples of working with popular TON DEXes (Decentralized EXchanges), which often require many contracts and complex logic:

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card
    arrow
    title="DeDust.io"
    href="/cookbook/dexes/dedust"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    arrow
    title="STON.fi"
    href="/cookbook/dexes/stonfi"
  />
</Cards>

</Steps>
