## How to get the current time

Use the `now(){:tact}` method to obtain the current standard [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

If you need to store the time in state or encode it in a message, use the following [serialization](/book/integers#serialization): `Int as uint32{:tact}`.

```tact
let currentTime: Int = now();

if (currentTime > 1672080143) {
    // do something
}
```
