## How to throw errors

The `throw(){:tact}` function in a contract is useful when we don't know how often to perform a specific action.

It allows intentional exception or error handling, which leads to the termination of the current transaction and reverts any state changes made during that transaction.

```tact
let number: Int = 198;

// the error will be triggered anyway
throw(36);

// the error will be triggered only if the number is greater than 50
nativeThrowWhen(35, number > 50);

// the error will be triggered only if the number is NOT EQUAL to 198
nativeThrowUnless(39, number == 198);
```

## How to generate a random number

```tact
// Declare a variable to store the random number
let number: Int;

// Generate a new random number, which is an unsigned 256-bit integer
number = randomInt();

// Generate a random number between 1 and 12
number = random(1, 12);
```
