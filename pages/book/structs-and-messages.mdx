# Structs and Messages

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

Tact supports a number of [primitive data types](/book/types#primitive-types) that are tailored for smart contract use. However, using individual means of storage often becomes cumbersome, so there are [Structs](#structs) and [Messages](#messages) which allow combining types together.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">

  **Warning**: Currently circular types are **not** possible. This means that Struct/Message **A** can't have a field of a Struct/Message **B** that has a field of the Struct/Message **A**.

  Therefore, the following code **won't** compile:

  ```tact
  struct A {
      circularFieldA: B;
  }

  struct B {
      impossibleFieldB: A;
  }
  ```

</Callout>

## Structs

Structs can define complex data types that contain multiple fields of different types. They can also be nested.

```tact
struct Point {
    x: Int as int64;
    y: Int as int64;
}

struct Line {
    start: Point;
    end: Point;
}
```

Structs can also include both default fields and optional fields. This can be quite useful when you have many fields but don't want to keep respecifying them.

```tact
struct Params {
    name: String = "Satoshi";  // default value
    age: Int?;                 // optional field
    point: Point;              // nested Structs
}
```

Structs are also useful as return values from getters or other internal functions. They effectively allow a single getter to return multiple return values.

```tact
contract StructsShowcase {
    params: Params; // Struct as a Contract persistent state variable

    init() {
        self.params = Params{point: Point{x: 4, y: 2}};
    }

    get fun params(): Params {
        return self.params;
    }
}
```

The order of fields does not matter. Unlike other languages, Tact does not have any padding between fields.

## Messages

Messages can hold [Structs](#structs) in them:

```tact
struct Point {
    x: Int;
    y: Int;
}

message Add {
    point: Point; // holds a struct Point
}
```

Messages are almost the same thing as [Structs](#structs) with the only difference that Messages have a 32-bit integer header in their serialization containing their unique numeric id. This allows Messages to be used with [receivers](/book/receive) since the contract can tell different types of messages apart based on this id.

Tact automatically generates those unique ids for every received Message, but this can be manually overwritten:

```tact
// This Message overwrites its unique id with 0x7362d09c
message(0x7362d09c) TokenNotification {
    forwardPayload: Slice as remaining;
}
```

This is useful for cases where you want to handle certain opcodes (operation codes) of a given smart contract, such as [Jetton standard](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md). The short-list of opcodes this contract is able to process is [given here in FunC](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/ft/op-codes.fc). They serve as an interface to the smart contract.
