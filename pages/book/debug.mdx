# Debugging Tact Contracts

Tact has first-class support for Jest and `@tact-lang/emulator` for contract tests and debugging. The preferred type of test is the one with inline snapshots. They are easy to write and easy to debug.

For a quick start, it is better to use `tact-template` that has everything built in.

## Printing out debug data

Tact has a built-in `dump` function that is similar to the one in FunC that allows you to print out data in your contract. It is very useful for debugging.

To make `dump` work you need to enable the feature `debug` in `tact.conf.json`.

Example:
```tact
dump("Hello World");
dump(123 + 444);
dump(a != null);
```

## Using `@tact-lang/emulator`

Ton Emulator allows you to have a small virtual blockchain in your Node.js code. This library is built specifically for testing smart contracts in unit tests.

```typescript
import { ContractSystem } from '@tact-lang/emulator';
import { sample_Contract } from './output/sample_Contract';

//
// Init System
//

// Contract System is a virtual environment that emulates the TON blockchain
const system = await ContractSystem.create();

// Treasure is a contract that has 1m of TONs and is a handy entry point for your smart contracts
let treasure = await system.treasure('name of treasure');

//
// Open contract
//

// Contract itself
let contract = system.open(sample_Contract.fromInit(treasure.address));

// This object would track all transactions in this contract
let tracker = system.track(contract.address);

// This object would track all logs
let logger = system.log(contract.address);

//
// Sending a message
//

// First we enqueue messages. NOTE: You can enqueue multiple messages in a row
await contract.send(treasure, { value: toNano(1) }, { $$type: "Deploy", queryId: 0n });
await contract.send(treasure, { value: toNano(1) }, { $$type: "Increment" });

// Run the system until there are no more messages
await system.run();

//
// Collecting results
//

console.log(track.collect()); // Prints out all transactions in contract
console.log(logger.collect()); // Prints out all logs for each transaction

//
// Invoking get methods
//

let counter = await contract.getCounter();
console.log(counter); // Prints out counter value

```

## Snapshot testing with `jest`

One of the most powerful features of Jest is the ability to write snapshot tests. Snapshot tests are a great way to test your contracts.

### Initial setup

Example of a minimal test file:

```typescript
import { ContractSystem } from '@tact-lang/emulator';
import { sample_Contract } from './output/sample_Contract';

describe("contract", () => {
    it("should deploy correctly", async () => {

        // Init test
        const system = await ContractSystem.create();
        const treasure = await system.treasure('my treasure');
        const contract = system.open(sample_Contract.fromInit(treasure.address));
        const tracker = system.track(contract.address);

        // Send a message
        await contract.send(treasure, { value: toNano(1) }, { $$type: "Deploy", queryId: 0n });
        await system.run();

        // Testing output
        expect(tracker.collect()).toMatchInlineSnapshot();
    });
});
```

### Generating snapshots

After running the `yarn jest` command, the line with `toMatchInlineSnapshot` of the test will be automatically updated with a snapshot of the output.

```typescript
// ...
        expect(tracker.collect()).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
            [
              {
                "$seq": 0,
                "events": [
                  {
                    "$type": "deploy",
                  },
                  {
                    "$type": "received",
                    "message": {

                        "type": "cell",
                      },
                      "bounce": true,

                      "to": "kQBrSAP2y7QIUw4_1q0qciHfqdFmOYR9CC1oinn7kyWWRuoV",

                      "value": 1000000000n,
                    },
                  },
                  {
                    "$type": "processed",
                    "gasUsed": 6077n,
                  },
                  {
                    "$type": "sent",
                    "messages": [
                      {
                        "body": {
                          "cell": "x{AFF90F570000000000000000}",
                          "type": "cell",
                        },
                        "bounce": true,
                        "from": "kQBrSAP2y7QIUw4_1q0qciHfqdFmOYR9CC1oinn7kyWWRuoV",
                        "to": "kQAI-3FJVc_ywSuY4vq0bYrzR7S4Och4y7bTU_i5yLOB3A6P",
                        "type": "internal",
                        "value": 992727000n,
                      },
                    ],
                  },
                ],
              },
            ]
        `);
// ...
```

### Updating snapshots

When you change your contract, your snapshots will be outdated. For example, gas usage or addresses were changed. To update them, you need to run the `yarn jest -u` command.
