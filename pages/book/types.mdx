# Tact type system

Every variable, item, and value in a Tact program has a type:

* Primitives: Int, Bool, Slice, Cell, Builder, String and StringBuilder;
* Map
* Structs and Messages
* Contracts and Traits

Also, most primitive types, structs, and messages could be nullable.

## Primitive types

* Int - all integers in Tact are 257-bit signed integers.
* Bool - classical boolean with true/false values.
* Address - standard address.
* Slice, Cell, Builder - low-level primitive of TON VM.
* String - type that represents text strings in TON VM.
* StringBuilder - helper type that allows you to concatenate strings in a gas-efficient way

## Structs and Messages

Structs and Messages are almost the same thing with the only difference being that a message has a header in its serialization and therefore could be used as receivers.

> **Warning**
> Currently circular **types** are not possible. This means that struct/message **A** can't have a field of a struct/message **B** that has a field of the struct/message **A**.

Example:
```tact
struct Point {
    x: Int;
    y: Int;
}

message SetValue {
    key: Int;
    value: Int?; // Optional
}
```

## Maps

The type `map<k, v>` is used as a way to associate data with corresponding keys.

Possible key types:
* Int
* Address

Possible value types:
* Int
* Bool
* Cell
* Address
* Struct/Message

```tact
contract HelloWorld {
  counters: map<Int, Int>;
}
```

## Contracts

Contracts are the main entry of a smart contract on the TON blockchain. It holds all functions, getters, and receivers of a contract.

```tact
contract HelloWorld {
  counter: Int;

  init() {
    self.counter = 0;
  }

  receive("increment") {
    self.counter = self.counter + 1;
  }

  get fun counter(): Int {
    return self.counter;
  }
}
```

## Traits

Tact doesn't support classical class inheritance, but instead introduces the concept of **traits**. Trait defines functions, receivers, and required fields. The trait is like abstract classes, but it does not define how and where fields must be stored. **All** fields from all traits must be explicitly declared in the contract itself. Traits itself also don't have constructors and all initial field initialization also must be done in the main contract.

```tact
trait Ownable {
    owner: Address;

    fun requireOwner() {
        nativeThrowUnless(132, context().sender == self.owner);
    }

    get fun owner(): Address {
        return self.owner;
    }
}
```

And the contract that uses trait:

```tact
contract Treasure with Ownable {
  owner: Address; // Field from trait MUST be defined in contract itself

  // Here we init the way we need, trait can't specify how you must init owner field
  init(owner: Address) {
    self.owner = owner;
  }
}
```
