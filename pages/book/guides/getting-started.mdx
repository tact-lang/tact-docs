# Welcome to Tact

There are two ways to start with Tact: using a template or starting from scratch.

We recommend using a template, as it contains a **simple contract** that can be deployed to the TON blockchain, along with examples of implementing unit tests and helper functions for contract deployment.

## Getting started from template

To get started, you can use the template project. It contains a simple contract that can be deployed to the TON blockchain, as well as examples of implementing unit tests and helper functions for contract deployment.

> To create a project from the template, simply create a new repository from the template project: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-template.

## Getting started from scratch

Tact is distributed via `npm` package manager and is meant to be installed to TypeScript/JavaScript projects:

```bash
yarn add @tact-lang/compiler
```

Then you need to create a `tact.config.json` file in the root of your project. It should contain the following:

```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "name": "sample",
      "path": "./sources/contract.tact",
      "output": "./sources/output"
    }
  ]
}
```

Add an example contract to `./sources/contract.tact`:

```tact
import "@stdlib/deploy";

message Add {
    amount: Int as uint32;
}

contract SampleTactContract with Deployable, {

    owner: Address;
    counter: Int as uint32;

    init(owner: Address) {
        self.owner = owner;
        self.counter = 0;
    }

    fun add(v: Int) {

        // Check sender
        let ctx: Context = context();
        require(ctx.sender == self.owner, "Invalid sender");

        // Update counter
        self.counter = (self.counter + v);
    }

    receive(msg: Add) {
        self.add(msg.amount);
    }

    receive("increment") {
        self.add(1);
    }

    get fun counter(): Int {
        return self.counter;
    }
}
```

Add a build script to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tact --config ./tact.config.json"
  }
}
```

Now you can run `yarn build` and get the compiled contract in `./sources/output` folder.
