# Maps

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

The type `map<k, v>{:tact}` is used as a way to associate keys of type `k` with corresponding values of type `v`.

Possible key types:

* [`Int{:tact}`][ints]
* `Address{:tact}`

Possible value types:

* [`Int{:tact}`][ints]
* [`Bool{:tact}`](/book/types#booleans)
* `Cell{:tact}`
* `Address{:tact}`
* [Struct](/book/structs-and-messages#structs)
* [Message](/book/structs-and-messages#messages)

For example, `map<Int, Int>{:tact}` uses [`Int{:tact}`][ints] type for its keys and values:

```tact
struct IntToInt {
    counters: map<Int, Int>;
}
```

Additionally, maps allow [integer serialization](/book/integers#serialization-types) of their keys, values or both to [preserve space and reduce storage costs](/book/integers#serialization):

```tact
struct SerializedMapInside {
    countersButCompact: map<Int as uint8, Int as uint8>;
}
```
