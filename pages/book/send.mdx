# Sending messages

TON blockchain is a message-based one to communicate with other contracts you need to send messages. 

The message consists of:
* `value` in TON - the amount of TON you want to send with the message. This value is used to cover gas fees on the receiver side.
* `bounce` - if set to `true` (default) then the message will be bounced back to the sender if the receiver contract doesn't exist or wasn't able to process the message.
* `code` and `data` - init package, useful for deployments
* `body` - message body as `Cell`
* `mode` - an 8-bit flag that configures how to send a message

## Send simple reply

The simplest message is a reply to the incoming message returning all excess value of a message:

```tact
self.reply("Hello, World!".asComment()); // asComment converts string to a Cell with a comment
```

## Send message

If you need more advanced logic you can use the `send` function directly.

This example sends a message to the `to` address with a `value` of 1 TON and the `body` of a comment with a string "Hello, World!".

`SendIgnoreErrors` means that even when an error occurs during message sending next messages would be sent anyway. **No error during the sending phase would revert a transaction.**

```tact
let to: Address = ...;
let value: Int = ton("1");
send(SendParameters{
    to: to,
    value: value, 
    mode: SendIgnoreErrors, 
    bounce: true, 
    body: "Hello, World!".asComment()
});
```

## Send typed message

To send a binary typed message you can use the following code:

```tact
let to: Address = ...;
let value: Int = ton("1");
send(SendParameters{
    to: to,
    value: value, 
    mode: SendIgnoreErrors, 
    bounce: true, 
    body: SomeMessage{arg1: 123, arg2: 1234}.toCell()
});
```

## Deploy contract

To deploy a contract you need to calculate its address and initial state with [`initOf{:tact}`](/book/expressions#initof), then send them in the initialization message:

```tact
let init: StateInit = initOf SecondContract(arg1, arg2);
let address: Address = contractAddress(init);
let value: Int = ton("1");
send(SendParameters{
    to: address,
    value: value, 
    mode: SendIgnoreErrors, 
    bounce: true, 
    code: init.code,
    data: init.data,
    body: "Hello, World!".asComment()
});
```
