# Cells, Builders and Slices

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

{/*
TODO:
* Refine drafts (quickly!) and remove all TODOs from this page
* (Optional?) How to parse emitted messages (in TS and/or other languages with bindings)
*/}

[Cells](#cells), [Builders](#builders) and [Slices](#slices) are low-level [primitives](/book/types#primitive-types) of TON Blockchain. The virtual machine of TON Blockchain, [TVM][tvm], uses cells to represent all data structures in memory and persistent storage.

## Cells

{/*
TODO: (move from drafts)
* Don't describe everything, write from the Tact POV. Everything else can be linked to TON Docs.
 */}

## Builders

{/*
TODO: (move from drafts)
* Construction of Cells with Builders.
* Recommend using structs :)
  "I strongly recommend you to use structs in Tact instead of manually composing and parsing cells"
*/}

## Slices

{/*
TODO: (move from drafts)
* Parsing of Cells with Slices.
* Recommend using structs :)
  "I strongly recommend you to use structs in Tact instead of manually composing and parsing cells"
*/}

## Serialization

{/*
  TODO: (move drafts over)
  Similar to [`Int{:tact}`](/book/integers), some serialization options of `Cell{:tact}`, `Builder{:tact}` and `Slice{:tact}` types ..........
*/}

## Operations

### Manual construction and parsing [#operations-manual]

{<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Construction</th>
      <th>Construction</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  </tbody>
</table>}

{/*
TODO: (move over from drafts)
* showcase the construction and parsing side by side, using the Builder and a Slice
Pick one (2nd?):
marshalling/demarshalling
composition(or construction)/parsing
store/load
*/}

### Using Structs for automatic construction and parsing [#operations-structs]

{/* TODO: add a simplified parsing version via .toCell() and .fromCell() references */}
