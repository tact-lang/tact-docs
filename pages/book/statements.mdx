# Statements

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

The following statements can appear anywhere in the [function](/book/functions) body.

## `let` statement [#let]

The `let{:tact}` statement allows local and [block](#block)-scoped variable declaration.

In Tact, declaring a variable always requires an initial value and an explicit type:

```tact
let value: Int = 123;           // declaration
let valueOptional: Int? = null; // Int or null

let valueMap: map<Int, Int> = emptyMap();
let valueMapWithSerialization: map<Int as uint8, Int as uint8> = emptyMap();
```

## `return` statement [#return]

The `return{:tact}` statement ends [function](/book/functions) execution and specifies a value to be returned to the [function](/book/functions) caller.

```tact
// Simple wrapper over stdlib function now()
fun getTimeFromNow(offset: Int): Int {
    return now() + offset;
}
```

## Block

A block statement is used to group zero or more statements. The block is delimited by a pair of braces ("curly braces", `{}{:tact}`) and contains a list of zero or more statements and declarations.

```tact
{ // <- start of the block
    // arbitrary statements:
    let value: Int = 2 + 2;
    dump(value);
} // <- end of the block

{ dump(2 + 2); } // a block with only one statement
```

## Expression

An expression statement is an expression used in a place where a statement is expected. The expression is evaluated and its result is discarded — therefore, it makes sense only for expressions that have side effects, such as executing a function or updating a variable.

```tact
dump(2 + 2); // stdlib function
```

## Assignment

Assignment statements use an [assignment operator](/book/operators#assignment) (`={:tact}`) or [augmented assignment operators](/book/operators#augmented-assignment) (assignments combined with an operation):

```tact
let value: Int; // declaration
value = 5;      // assignment
value += 5;     // augmented assignment (one of the many, see below)
```

<Callout>

  Read more about assignment and augmented assignment in their dedicated section: [assignment operators](/book/operators#assignment).

## Branches

Control the flow of the code.

### `if...else` [#if-else]

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">

  Curly brackets (code blocks) are required!

</Callout>

When executing an `if...else{:tact}` statement, first, the specified condition gets evaluated. If the resulting value is `true{:tact}`, the `then{:tact}` statement block gets executed. Otherwise, if the condition evaluates to `false{:tact}`, the optional `else{:tact}` statement block will be executed. If the `else{:tact}` block is missing, nothing happens and execution continues further.

Regular `if{:tact}`-statement:

```tact
// condition
// ↓
if (true) { // consequence, when condition is true
    dump(2 + 2);
}
```

With `else{:tact}` clause:

```tact
// condition
// ↓
if (2 + 2 == 4) {
    // consequence, when condition is true
    dump(true);
} else {
    // alternative, when condition is false
    dump(false);
}
```

With nested `if...else{:tact}`:

```tact
// condition
// ↓
if (2 + 2 == 3) {
    // consequence, when condition is true
    dump("3?");
//        condition2
//        ↓
} else if (2 + 2 == 4) {
    // another consequence, when condition2 is true
    dump(true);
} else {
    // alternative, when both condition and condition2 are false
    dump(false);
}
```

<Callout>

  Tact also has a ternary expression `?:{:tact}`, which is described earlier in the Book: [Ternary](/book/operators#ternary).

## Loops

Conditionally repeat certain blocks of code multiple times.

### `repeat` [#repeat-loop]

The `repeat{:tact}` loop executes a block of code a specified number of times. Number of repetitions must be a non-negative $32$-bit [`Int{:tact}`](/book/integers). Otherwise an error with the [exit code 5](/book/exit-codes#5), `Integer out of the expected range` would be thrown.

In the following example, code inside the loop will be executed $10$ times:

```tact
let a: Int = 1;
repeat (10) {
    a *= a;
}
```

### `while` [#while-loop]

While loop continues executing the block of code as long as the given condition is `true{:tact}`.

In the following example, the value of `x` is decremented by $1$ on each iteration, so the loop will run $10$ times:

```tact
let x: Int = 10;
while (x > 0) {
    x -= 1;
}
```

### `do...until` [#do-until-loop]

The `do...until{:tact}` loop is a post-test loop that executes the block of code at least once, and then continues to execute it until the given condition becomes `true{:tact}`.

In the following example, the value of `x` is decremented by $1$ on each iteration, so the loop will run $10$ times:

```tact
let x: Int = 10;
do {
    x -= 1;  // executes this code block at least once
} until (x <= 0);
```
