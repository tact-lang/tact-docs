# Statements

## Variable declaration

Declaring variable always requires an initial value and an explicit type:

```tact
let value: Int = 123;
```

## Static function call

Anywhere in the function body, a static function can be called:

```tact
let expiration: Int = now() + 1000; // now() is stdlib static function
```

## Extension function call

Some functions are defined only for specific types, they can be called this way:

```tact
let some: String = 95.toString(); // toString() is a stdlib function that is defined on Int type
```

## Operators

Tact supports operations:

- `!!` suffix operator - enforces non-null value, defined only for nullable types.
- `!` - logical inversion, defined only for the `Bool` type.
- `/`, `*`, `%` - division and multiplication operations, defined only for the `Int` type
- `-`, `+` - arithmetic operations, defined only for `Int` type
- `!=`, `==` - equality operations
- `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` - compare operations, defined only for the `Int` type
- `&&`, `||` - logical `AND` and `OR`

## Loops

### Repeat loop

The Repeat Loop executes a block of code a specified number of times. In the example you provided, the code inside the loop will be executed 10 times.

```tact
let a: Int = 1;
repeat(10) {
  a = a * a;
}
```

> **Note**
> Repeat number must be a 32-bit int or of range exception is thrown. Negative values are ignored.

### While loop

The While Loop continues executing the block of code as long as the given condition is true.

```tact
let x: Int = 10;
while(x > 0) {
  x = x - 1;
}
```

**Explanation**:

- The code inside the loop will execute as long as � > 0 x>0.
- In the example, the value of � x is decremented by 1 in each iteration, so the loop will run 10 times.

### Until loop

The Until Loop is a post-test loop that executes the block of code at least once and then continues to execute it until the given condition becomes true.

```tact
let x: Int = 10;
do {
  x = x - 1;  # do something no matter at least one time
} until (x <= 0);
```

**Explanation**:

- The code inside the loop will execute at least once, and then it will continue to execute until \( x \leq 0 \).
- In the example, the value of \( x \) is decremented by 1 in each iteration, so the loop will run 10 times.

## If Statements

> **Warn**
> Curly brackets are required

```tact
if (condition) {
  doSomething();
}
```

```tact
if (condition) {
  doSomething();
} else {
  doSomething2();
}
```

```tact
if (condition) {
  doSomething();
} else if (condition2) {
  doSomething2();
} else {
  doSomething3();
}
```

## initOf

Allows to compute init state for a contract:

```tact
let state: StateInit = initOf Contract(123, 123);
```
