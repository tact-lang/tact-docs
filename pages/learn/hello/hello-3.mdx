# Tact Hello World

## Tact contract structure

### Tact's facts #3

#### Contracts and Messages
A lot of important details you should learn to understand how TON works, but here, we simplify our field of knowledge and goals.
So, let's say, **contracts** and **messages** are our main characters in blockchain.

1. **Contract** - is a computer program that lives on the blockchain. It can store information and carry out certain actions based on the instructions that are written inside it.

2. **Message** - is a command that we send to the contract. It tells the contract what to do and can include information like how much funds to transfer or what information to deliver.

On the scheme, you can see a representation of how blockchain works, where different **contracts** communicate with each other by **messages**.

#### Get functions
Additional general tool, that extends functions of the contract - is **getter** or **get function**. This feature allows to get read-only information from contract's data. Usually, get-function is using to deliver information(for example, smart-contract current balance) to the application, but it is impossible to call it from another contract.

#### Smart contract development
In summary, the main goal of smart contract developers is to declare and write the logic of actions in a smart contract correspondingly to messages it gets from other smart contracts. If it is necessary to get information and deliver it off-chain(common web app), there are get functions that should be declared.

Let's talk about the design of our contract.
Our smart contract is like a piggy bank with several common features:
1. _Keep Total value_. We will keep `Total` integer value in blockchain.
2. _Get Total value_. Special tool for reading current `Total` value from blockchain. We can read this directly from blockchain via special `get` method.
3. _Processing "Increment" text comment command_. When contract gets a message, it checks what the message says. If the message says "Increment," it will add `1` to the `Total` inside the piggy bank and update it.
4. _Processing `Add` message command_. If the message says "Add," it will add a specific number to the Total inside the piggy bank and update it.

Additional restriction for our smart contract - It will check if the person sending the message is the owner of the piggy bank or not. This way, only the owner can add or increment the `Total` inside the piggy bank.

### Tactical practice #3
#### Import modules

Come back to `tact-guide-template` project via IDE(VS Code) and begin to write the contract file `contract.tact`. That, our first Tact string is declaring an additional library, where some useful Tact functions are defined.

```tact
import "@stdlib/deploy";
```

`@stdlib/deploy` module extends our tools with `Trait` Deployable, so we can use it Trait later for implementing contract's deployment feature easier.
Note, that Tact language consists of some unusual for classic program language entities, here is what we face in this guide:

| Type     | Description                                                                                                                                            |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Contract | Tact type that declares `contract` entity in it's `{}` block.                                                                                          |
| Message  | Tact type for convenient `message`'s declaration.                                                                                                      |
| Trait    | Struct similar to Contract, but serves as extension for Contract(it's similar to interfaces or inheritance for Classes in classic Objectâ€‘oriented PL). |
| Address  | Smart contract address in according TON standards. You'll see this parameter as sender or destination of messages.                                     |

Read more on the [Tact type system](../../guides/types) page.

#### Define Structure
Next step, we need to specify our message `Add`, that will force contract do actions according to 4th feature.
Here we specified, that our message should content Integer number of 32-bit length.

```tact
//previous code
message Add{
  amount: Int as uint32;
}
```

#### Contract body and fields
Now we begin declare our contract, we will call it SampleTactContract. Also, we need specify our contract's own properties, that will be stored in its storage: `owner` and `counter`.

```tact
//previous code

contract SampleTactContract with Deployable {

  owner: Address;
  counter: Int as uint32;

```

As said before `Address` defined in the Tact [Type system](../../../ton-docs/ton-docs/docs/develop/tact/docs/tact-types.md) that describes smart-contract's language. General information about Address in TON placed [here](../../../ton-docs/ton-docs/docs/learn/overviews/addresses.md).
* `owner` - is Address of owner set in for `SampleTactContract`, and we will use it for double check if message sent by owner or not.
* `counter` - integer number stored in contract that keep current value of iteration results.

#### Writing Init function

Before we can use contract in Blockchain we should define its initial process. In our case, it means, that we should declare contract's function, that will define our `owner` and `counter` in particular.
This tool in smart contracts called `init()` function, and we need describe its behaviour next:

```tact
//previous code

init(owner: Address) {
  self.owner = owner;
  self.counter = 0;
}
```

Where `self` - special Tact keyword of current level struct, here we using it for contract's fields we declared. Function `init()` will:
* Accept one argument of type `Address`, set this in contract's field `owner`.
* Initialize `counter` value equal to 0.

```tact
//previous code

contract SampleTactContract with Deployable {

  owner: Address;
  counter: Int as uint32;

  init(owner: Address) {
    self.owner = owner;
    self.counter = 0;
  }

// receivers definition here

// get functions definition here
```


We defined basic structure of our contract. Next step is adding receivers and get functions.
