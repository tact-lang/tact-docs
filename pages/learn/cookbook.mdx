## Basics
### How to write exception statements

To declare exceptions in Tact suggested to use special function `require(condition, error message)`

```tact
//  throw "Empty counter" message when condition is equal True

require(ok1 && ok2 && ok3, "Invalid signature");

require(ctx.value >= ton("1"), "Invalid value");
```

Highly recommended to avoid native Func functions like `nativeThrow()`.
