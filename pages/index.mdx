Tact is a new programming language for TON Blockchain that is focused on efficiency and simplicity. It is designed to be easy to learn and use, and to be a good fit for smart contracts. Tact is a statically typed language with a simple syntax and a powerful type system.

## Let's start! [#start]

<Steps>

### Ensure that Node.js LTS is installed and available [#start-1]

To check it, run `node --version{:shell}` — it should show you the version 18.0.0 or later.

### Run the following command [#start-2]

It will create a new project with the simple counter contract:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```shell
    npm create ton -- simple-counter --type tact-counter --contractName SimpleCounter
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```shell
    yarn create ton simple-counter --type tact-counter --contractName SimpleCounter
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```shell
    pnpm create ton simple-counter --type tact-counter --contractName SimpleCounter
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### That's it! [#start-3]

Your first contract project is written and compiled already! Go check it out by moving into the relevant directory — `cd simple-counter/contracts{:shell}`.

It will look like this, but without the comments:

```tact
import "@stdlib/deploy"; // one of the standard libraries

// Defining a new Message type, which consists of two fields
message Add {
    queryId: Int as uint64; // unsigned integer value stored in 8 bytes
    amount: Int as uint32; // unsigned integer value stored in 4 bytes
}

// Defining a contract with the Deployable trait from @stdlib/deploy:
contract SimpleCounter with Deployable {
    // Persistent state variables of the contract:
    id: Int as uint32;
    counter: Int as uint32;

    // This gets run when the contract is deployed.
    // All state variables have to be initialized with either of:
    // 1. default values in their definition above
    // 2. assignments in the init()
    init(id: Int) { // <- you can pass values for deployment
        self.id = id;     // <- store the id passed on deployment
        self.counter = 0; // <- reset the counter
    }

    // Register a receiver of messages from other contracts.
    // Messages in Tact can be one of the two:
    // 1. Message type, as defined above
    // 2. String type, like "I am the message!"
    receive(msg: Add) {
        self.counter += msg.amount; // <- increase the counter
    }

    // This is a getter function, which are special external interface functions
    // that allow users to query information from the contract.
    get fun counter(): Int {
        return self.counter; // <- return the counter value
    }

    // Another getter function, but for the id:
    get fun id(): Int {
        return self.id; // <- return the id value
    }
}
```

To re-compile or deploy, refer to the commands in the scripts section of `package.json` in the root of this newly created projec and to the documentation of [Blueprint](https://github.com/ton-org/blueprint) — this is a tool we've used to create and compile your first simple counter contract in Tact. In fact, Blueprint can do much more than that: including tests, customizations and more.
