Tact is a new programming language for TON Blockchain that is focused on efficiency and simplicity. It is designed to be easy to learn and use, and to be a good fit for smart contracts. Tact is a statically typed language with a simple syntax and a powerful type system.

## Let's start! [#start]

<Steps>

### Ensure that Node.js LTS is installed and available

To check it, run `node --version{:shell}` — it should show you the version 18.0.0 or later.

### Run the following command to create a new project with the simple counter contract

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```shell
    npm create ton -- simple-counter --type tact-counter --contractName SimpleCounter
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```shell
    yarn create ton -- simple-counter --type tact-counter --contractName SimpleCounter
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```shell
    pnpm create ton simple-counter --type tact-counter --contractName SimpleCounter
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### That's it! Your first contract project is written and compiled already!

Go check it out by moving into the relevant directory — `cd simple-counter/contracts{:shell}`.

To re-compile, use commands in the scripts section of `package.json` in the root of this newly created project.

To deploy, refer to the documentation of [Blueprint](https://github.com/ton-org/blueprint) — this is a tool we've used to create and compile your first simple counter contract in Tact. In fact, Blueprint can do much more than that: including tests, customizations and more.
