## readForwardFee

```tact
extends fun readForwardFee(self: Context): Int
```

Read and compute forward fee from the `Context{:tact}` and return it as `Int{:tact}` value in nanoToncoins (nano-tons).

## throw

```tact
fun throw(code: Int);
```

Throw an exception with error code equal `code`.

## nativeThrowWhen

```tact
fun nativeThrowWhen(code: Int, condition: Bool);
```

Throw an exception with error code equal to `code` when `condition` is equal to `true{:tact}`.

## nativeThrowUnless

```tact
fun nativeThrowUnless(code: Int, condition: Bool);
```

Throw an exception with error code equal to `code` when `condition` is equal to `false{:tact}`.

## getConfigParam

```tact
fun getConfigParam(id: Int): Cell?;
```

Load network configuration parameter from the blockchain.

## nativeRandomize

```tact
fun nativeRandomize(x: Int);
```

Randomize the random number generator with the specified seed `x`.

## nativeRandomizeLt

```tact
fun nativeRandomizeLt();
```

Randomize the random number generator with the current logical time.

## nativePrepareRandom

```tact
fun nativePrepareRandom();
```

This function prepares random number generator by calling [nativeRandomizeLt](#nativeRandomizeLt) once and called internally by [random](#random) and [randomInt](#randomInt) functions.

## nativeRandom

```tact
fun nativeRandom(): Int;
```

You shouldn't use this function directly, use [random](#random) and [randomInt](#randomInt) functions instead.\
This function generates 256-bit random number just like [randomInt](#randomInt) function, but random generator is not initialized by [nativePrepareRandom](#nativePrepareRandom) function.

## nativeRandomInterval

```tact
fun nativeRandomInterval(max: Int): Int;
```

You shouldn't use this function directly, use [random](#random) and [randomInt](#randomInt) functions instead.\
This function generates random number in the range from 0 to `max`. This call doesn't prepare initialization by [nativePrepareRandom](#nativePrepareRandom) function.

## nativeReserve

```tact
fun nativeReserve(amount: Int, mode: Int);
```

Calls native `raw_reserve` function with specified amount and mode. The `raw_reserve` is a function that creates an output action to reserve a specific amount of nanoToncoins (nano-tons) from the remaining balance of the account.

It has the following signature in FunC:

```func
raw_reserve(int amount, int mode) impure asm "RAWRESERVE";
```

The function takes two arguments:
* `amount`: The number of nanotoncoins to reserve.
* `mode`: Determines the reservation behavior.

The resulting `mode` value can have the following base modes:
* $0$: Reserve exactly amount nanotoncoins.
* $1$ or $3$: Reserve all but amount nanotoncoins.
* $2$: Reserve at most amount nanotoncoins.

Additionally, the resulting `mode` can have the following optional flags added:
* $+2$: If the specified amount cannot be reserved, reserve the remaining balance instead of failing.
* $+4$: Increase amount by the original balance of the current account (before the compute phase), including all extra currencies.
* $+8$: Negate the amount before performing further actions.

Function `raw_reserve` is roughly equivalent to creating an outbound message carrying the specified `amount` of nanoToncoins (or `b`-amount nanoToncoins, where `b` is the remaining balance) to oneself. This ensures that subsequent output actions cannot spend more money than the remainder.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Currently, `amount` must be a non-negative integer, and `mode` must be in the range 0..15, inclusive.
