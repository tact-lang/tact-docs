## TON Enhancement Protocols (TEPs)

The main goal of TON Enhancement Proposals is to provide a convenient and formal way to propose changes to TON Blockchain and standardize ways of interaction between different parts of ecosystem. Proposal management is done using GitHub pull requests, the process is described formally in [TEP-1](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0001-tep-lifecycle.md).
