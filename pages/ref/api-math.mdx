Various math helper functions.

## checkSignature
```tact
fun checkSignature(hash: Int, signature: Slice, public_key: Int): Bool;
```
Checks the Ed25519 `signature` of `hash` (a 256-bit unsigned integer, usually computed as the hash of some data) using `public_key` (also represented by a 256-bit unsigned integer). The signature must contain at least 512 data bits; only the first 512 bits are used. If the signature is valid, the result is true; otherwise, it is false.
Note that `CHKSIGNU` creates a 256-bit slice with the `hash` and calls `CHKSIGNS`. That is, if hash is computed as the hash of some data, this data is hashed twice, the second hashing occurring inside `CHKSIGNS`.

## checkDataSignature
```tact
fun checkDataSignature(data: Slice, signature: Slice, public_key: Int): Bool;
```
Checks whether `signature` is a valid Ed25519 signature of the data portion of `data` using `public_key`, similarly to `checkSignature`. If the bit length of `data` is not divisible by eight, it throws a cell underflow exception. The verification of Ed25519 signatures is a standard one, with sha256 used to reduce `data` to the 256-bit number that is actually signed. If the signature is valid, the result is true; otherwise, it is false.

## sha256

```tact
fun sha256(data: Slice): Int;
fun sha256(data: String): Int;
```

Computes sha256 of byte-string. The result is a 256-bit unsigned integer. Slice or string must have no refs and have number of bits divisible by 8. Passing constant string computes hash in compile time that could be useful for some optimizations.

## min
```tact
fun min(x: Int, y: Int): Int;
```
Computes the minimum of two integers `x` and `y`.

## max
```tact
fun max(x: Int, y: Int): Int;
```
Computes the maximum of two integers `x` and `y`.

## abs
```tact
fun abs(x: Int): Int
```
Computes the absolute value of the integer `x`.
