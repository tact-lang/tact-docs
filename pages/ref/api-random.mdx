# Random number generation

Random number generation for Tact smart contracts.

## randomInt

```tact
fun randomInt(): Int;
```

Generates and returns a new pseudo-random unsigned $256$-bit [`Int{:tact}`][int] value `x`.

The algorithm works as follows: if `r` is the old value of the random seed considered a $32$-byte array (by constructing the big-endian representation of an unsigned $256$-bit [`Int{:tact}`][int]), then its `sha512(r){:tact}` is computed. The first $32$ bytes of this hash are stored as the new value `r'` of the random seed, and the remaining $32$ bytes are returned as the next random value `x`.

```tact
let allYourRandomBelongsToUs: Int = randomInt();
```

## random

```tact
fun random(from: Int, to: Int): Int;
```

Generates and returns a new pseudo-random unsigned [`Int{:tact}`][int] value `x` in the provided semi-closed interval: `from` $≤$ `x` $<$ `to` or `from` $≥$ `x` $>$ `to`, if both `from` and `to` are negative.

Usage example:

```tact
let itsAlways42: Int = random(42, 43);
```
