# Strings

Strings are a sequence of a characters. Strings are immutable, which means that once a string is created, it cannot be changed. Tact have a limitied support for strings, but you can use them to store text. Strings are also useful as comment messages body.

## beginString
```tact
fun beginString(): StringBuilder;
```
Creates new empty StringBuilder.

## beginComment
```tact
fun beginComment(): StringBuilder;
```
Creates new empty StringBuilder for comment.

## beginTailString
```tact
fun beginTailString(): StringBuilder;
```
Creates new empty StringBuilder for a tailstring. This format is used in various standards like NFT or Jetton.

## beginStringFromBuilder
```tact
fun beginStringFromBuilder(builder: Builder): StringBuilder;
```
Creates new StringBuilder from existing builder. Useful if you need to serialize string to a cell with some other data.

## StringBuilder.append
```tact
extends mutates fun append(self: StringBuilder, s: String);
```
Append to StringBuilder `self` String `s` and updates it.

## StringBuilder.toString
```tact
extends fun toString(self: StringBuilder): String;
```
Assembles a string from a builder's content.

## StringBuilder.toCell
```tact
extends fun toCell(self: StringBuilder): Cell
```
Assembles a cell from a builder's content.

## StringBuilder.toSlice
```tact
extends fun toSlice(self: StringBuilder): Slice;
```
Assembles a cell from builder's content into a slice. Alias to `self.toCell().asSlice()`.

## Int.toString
```tact
extends fun toString(self: Int): String;
```
Converts Int value to String

## Int.toFloatString
```tact
extends fun toFloatString(self: Int, digits: Int): String
```

Converts Fixed Float value that represented as Int to String

Where,
* `self` significant part of float number as Int number;
* `digits` is a exponentiation parameter of expression `10^(-digits)` that will be used for computing float number. `digits` required to be `0 <= digits < 77`.

## Int.toCoinsString
```tact
extends fun toCoinsString(self: Int): String
```
Converts nanoToncoin Int value `self` to String float number of Toncoins and returns it as a result.

## String.asComment
```tact
extends fun asComment(self: String): Cell
```
Converts String `self` to comment message body Cell.

## String.asSlice
```tact
extends fun asSlice(self: String): Slice;
```
**Dangerously** casts string as slice for future parsing. Use it only if you know what you are doing.

## Slice.asString

```tact
extends fun asString(self: Slice): String;
```

**Dangerously** casts slice as string. Use it only if you know what you are doing.

## String.fromBase64

```tact
extends fun fromBase64(self: String): Slice;
```

Decodes base64 string to a slice. NOTE: This method is very limited and can be used only for small strings that fits a single cell.

## Slice.fromBase64

```tact
extends fun fromBase64(self: Slice): Slice;
```

Decodes base64 slice to a slice. Alias for `self.asString().fromBase64()`
